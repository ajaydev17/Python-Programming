"""
Database connection pooling is a technique to manage a pool of database
connections for reuse, enhancing performance by reducing the overhead of creating new
connections. In Python, libraries like psycopg2 for PostgreSQL or mysql-connector offer
pooling options, and connection pools can also be implemented using SQLAlchemyâ€™s
create_engine function with a pool size.
