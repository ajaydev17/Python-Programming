"""
In Python, after making changes to a module that has already been imported, you can reload
it using the importlib.reload() function from the importlib module. This is particularly
useful during interactive sessions, where you want the interpreter to recognize updated code
without restarting the session. Reloading updates the imported module with the latest code,
making it ideal for debugging or testing changes.
"""

# first import the module and make some changes to it
import my_module

# to reload it with the latest changes
import importlib
importlib.reload(my_module)
