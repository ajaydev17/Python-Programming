"""
A module in Python is essentially a single file that contains Python code. It allows developers
to organize their code into logical sections. This is particularly useful in large projects where
all code in a single file could be overwhelming. By dividing the code into modules, you make
it more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain. Modules can contain functions, classes,
variables, and runnable code. By importing these modules, developers can access all of these
elements from any other file or script, promoting reusability and modularity.
"""

# Example of a basic module file: math_operations.py

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b


# We can then import and use this module in another file
# import math_operations
# result = math_operations.add(5, 3)
# print(result) # Output: 8

"""
In this example, math_operations.py acts as a module with functions add and subtract.
When you import math_operations, you can use its functions without rewriting them.
