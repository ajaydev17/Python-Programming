"""
Flask, being a lightweight and modular framework, is designed for flexibility rather
than built-in scalability. However, Flask applications can be made scalable by following best
practices such as using a production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI), employing
load balancers, and leveraging caching and database optimization.

For deployment in a production environment, Flask applications should be hosted behind a
web server like Nginx or Apache for handling requests, which provides better security,
performance, and load balancing. Using containerization tools like Docker can also
streamline deployment and make the application portable. For large-scale applications, Flask
can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of the application across different
servers and using a load balancer to distribute incoming requests.

For Example:
    ● Load Balancing: Use a load balancer like HAProxy or Nginx to route requests to
    multiple instances of the Flask application.
    ● Caching: Integrate with caching systems like Redis or Memcached to cache frequent
    requests.
    ● Database Optimization: Optimize database queries and consider using connection
    pooling.

Flask does not handle asynchronous requests natively, so for high-concurrency needs,
consider using a framework like FastAPI or asynchronous workers.
