"""
Djangoâ€™s Signals framework allows for decoupled components to communicate
with each other by sending notifications when certain events occur. Signals are especially
useful when certain actions need to trigger specific behavior in other parts of the application,
such as sending an email after user registration.
Django provides several built-in signals (e.g., post_save, pre_delete), and custom signals
can also be defined.
