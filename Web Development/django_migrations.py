"""
Django uses migrations to manage changes to the database schema over time.
Migrations are Python files generated automatically by Django when model changes are
detected. They contain instructions for applying changes (e.g., creating or modifying tables)
to the database.

Migrations help keep the database schema in sync with the models, allowing for incremental
changes without losing data. Each migration file can be applied, rolled back, or modified as
needed.

For Example:
    1. Run manage.py makemigrations to create migration files for new or modified
    models.
    2. Run manage.py migrate to apply migrations and update the database schema.
    Migration files allow Django to track changes to models and make adjustments in the
    database seamlessly.
