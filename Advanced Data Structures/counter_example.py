"""
The Counter class is a specialized dictionary for counting hashable objects. Hashable objects
(like strings, numbers, tuples) can be counted with ease by simply creating a Counter from
an iterable (e.g., a list or string). Itâ€™s particularly useful for counting occurrences, which is often
needed in applications like word frequency analysis, data summarization, or character
frequency in text analysis.

# Example of counting word occurrences
words = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']

print(counter) # Output: Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1})


# Finding the most common word
most_common_word = counter.most_common(1)
print(most_common_word) # Output: [('apple', 3)]
