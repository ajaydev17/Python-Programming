"""
Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python with names
that begin and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc. They
allow custom behaviors for built-in operations on objects, enabling operator overloading and
providing an interface for Pythonâ€™s built-in functions.
"""

"""
For example, __init__ initializes an object, __str__ represents an object as a string, and
__add__ enables the use of the + operator.
