"""
Multithreading in Python enables concurrent execution of multiple threads within
the same process. Each thread shares the same memory, making context switching
lightweight. However, due to the GIL, threads in Python are generally suited for I/O-bound
tasks, where threads wait for external resources.

For CPU-bound tasks, threads donâ€™t achieve true parallelism due to GIL limitations. However,
for I/O-bound operations (like file or network operations), threads are beneficial as they can
continue execution while waiting for I/O to complete.
