"""
: In the multiprocessing module, Lock ensures that only one process accesses a
shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions. Similar to threading.Lock,
multiprocessing.Lock is used to synchronize access to resources across multiple processes.

When a process acquires a lock, other processes attempting to acquire it will be blocked until
itâ€™s released, ensuring consistent access to shared data.
