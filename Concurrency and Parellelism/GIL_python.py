"""
The GIL in CPython allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time,
even on multi-core processors. This simplifies memory management but prevents true
parallelism in CPU-bound tasks. However, Python threads work well for I/O-bound tasks, as
the GIL releases control during I/O operations.

The GILâ€™s main impact is on CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation. In such cases,
using multiple processes with multiprocessing is preferable, as each process has its own
GIL and can run in true parallelism.
