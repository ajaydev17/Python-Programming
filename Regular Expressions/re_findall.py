: re.findall returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in a string, yielding a
list of all instances found. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you want all occurrences, not just the
first one or a match at the beginning. If the pattern contains capturing groups, findall
returns a list of tuples where each tuple represents the matched groups

In this case, \d{4} looks for any sequence of four consecutive digits. findall extracts every
match into a list, providing an easy way to retrieve multiple values from a single search.
