"""
The dot (.) metacharacter matches any character except a newline. Itâ€™s useful for
matching any single character when the content in between is not fixed, but should be
limited to a single line. To allow a dot to also match newlines, you can set the re.DOTALL flag,
which lets the dot match newline characters as well.
