"""
Pythonâ€™s contextlib module has a suppress function that allows you to ignore
specific exceptions within a with block. By passing an exception type to suppress, you can
prevent interruptions due to anticipated exceptions without needing a try-except
structure. This is useful for cases where an error is expected and non-critical, so it can be
safely ignored to allow the program to continue.
