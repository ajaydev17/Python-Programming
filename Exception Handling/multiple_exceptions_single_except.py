"""
You can handle multiple exceptions in a single except block by passing a tuple of
exceptions. This allows you to apply the same handling logic for different types of exceptions,
making the code more concise and readable. Itâ€™s particularly useful when similar actions (like
logging or retrying) are appropriate for multiple exceptions.
