"""
Load balancing with WebSocket servers can be managed by distributing client connections
across multiple WebSocket servers. This setup typically requires a load balancer (e.g., Nginx)
to route incoming WebSocket connections to different servers based on predefined rules or
load metrics. Python WebSocket servers, built using websockets or socketio, can be set up
on separate instances, with Nginx handling connection routing.
For Example (Nginx Configuration): To enable WebSocket load balancing, configure Nginx
with multiple backend servers:


http {
    upstream websocket_backend {
     server ws_server1:8765;
     server ws_server2:8765;
    }
     server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
         proxy_pass http://websocket_backend;
         proxy_http_version 1.1;
         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
         proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
    }
}
