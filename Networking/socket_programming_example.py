"""
Socket programming in Python allows communication between devices over a network. A
socket is an endpoint in communication between two devices. Pythonâ€™s socket library
enables developers to establish these connections using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
or UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP is connection-oriented, providing reliability by
confirming message delivery, while UDP is connectionless, prioritizing speed over reliability.
