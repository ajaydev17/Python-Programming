"""
File locking restricts simultaneous access to a file, preventing potential data
corruption in applications with multiple processes or users. Pythonâ€™s fcntl module
(for Unixbased systems) and msvcrt (for Windows) can lock files, ensuring only one process can write
to a file at a time. Use LOCK_EX for exclusive access and LOCK_UN to release it.
